# Paudit
Paudit is a password strength auditor that evaluates passwords against common vulnerabilities and security best practices. It provides a detailed analysis of password strength by checking for common weaknesses, estimating entropy, and calculating realistic breakthrough times for attackers.

## Features
The program has various features like check against the most overused passwords, calculating bit entropy (how difficult it is to crack the password), time to break the password, suggestion to improve the password and you can use this program as a CLLI tool or module.

## How it works
When you input a password the program runs through the list of 10,000+ passwords to see if yours is too common and then output to try another password or gives feedback.
   
## Installation
Make sure to download the lateste version of Python for your device and then download the text file and Python file, be sure to keep both files in the same folder.

## Usage
You can use any IDE of your choice and run the files in the folder you saved them and type in `python paudit.py` to run the program, then start testing passwords.
