# Paudit
Paudit is a password strength auditor that evaluates passwords against common vulnerabilities and security practices. 

## Features
The program has features to check if the passwords are overused, calculates bit entropy (how difficult it is to crack the password), shows the time it takes to break the password, and can make suggestions to improve the password.

## How it works
When you input a password the program runs through the list of 10,000+ passwords to see if yours is too common and then outputs to try another password or gives feedback.
   
## Installation
Make sure to download the latest version of Python for your device and then download the `Paudit` folder, be sure to keep everything in the same folder so can run the program properly.

## Usage
You can use any IDE of your choice and run the files in the folder you saved them and type in `python paudit.py` to run the program, then start testing passwords.
