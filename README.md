# Paudit
Paudit is a password strength auditor (whatever that means) and I made this to check for common passwords or give suggestions to make stronger passwords.
You can download Python and then the `Paudit` files, save everything together, and run `python paudit.py` in the terminal. Alternatively just clone the repo. Feel free to contribute :)
