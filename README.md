# Paudit
Paudit is a password strength auditor that evaluates passwords against common vulnerabilities and security practices. The program has features to check if the passwords are overused, calculates bit entropy (how difficult it is to crack the password), shows the time it takes to break the password, and can make suggestions to improve the password.
Download Python and then the `Paudit` files, save everything together, and run `python paudit.py` in the terminal. Alternatively just clone the repo. Feel free to contribute :)
